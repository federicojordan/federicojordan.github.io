<div class="about">
    <div>My main quality is the experience in the development of iOS applications, having worked for different companies in projects of various magnitudes for more than 6 years. I like to focus on maintainability, testing, process automation and architecture improvements.</div>
    <div>I am always in constant learning and move by my passion for technology, so that led me to learn other technologies such as Node.js, Java Backend, Java Android, React and React Native. 
    Regarding freelance work, I participated in projects on iOS mostly (Swift and ObjC), Android and React Native.</div>
    <div>Whenever I have time I like to share some knowledge with blog posts or doing a tech talk about what I learned. </div>
